Task 1: Sequence for human SOD2 protein and sequence of	a mouse	SOD2 protein
Alignment score:1091
Similarity between two sequences: 89.63963963963964%
These two sequences are the most similiar among three sequences, so in this gene sequence, humans and mice are closely related.

Task 2: Sequence for human SOD2 protein and a random sequence
Alignment score: -250
Similarity between two sequences: 5.405405405405405%
The human sequence and the random sequence are less similiar than others.

Task 3: Sequence of	a mouse	SOD2 protein and a random sequence
Alignment score: -250
Similarity between two sequences: 5.855855855855852%

The significance of the BLOSUM is to find different parts between two amino acid sequences, which means to figure out the conservatism of amino acids.
All the species have only one ancester, but during the long-term evolution, lots of gene materials have changed to better adapt to different environments.
The concervatism means that some gene materials still remain the same or remain highly similarity within different organisms despite evolution.
So the highly conserved genes play a quite important role in the animinals, and lots of deadly mutations happened in the conserved genes.
The most widely used one is BLOSUM62. The higher scores, the higher the similarity between the amino acids.
