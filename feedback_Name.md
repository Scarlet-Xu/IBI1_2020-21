This is my formative feedback to the IBI1 portfolio.
Practical 4:
I got 100% for this practical.
I think there is no improvement available for this practical, so no changes happened here.

Practical 5:
In Variables.py file, I made a comparison between d and e, but I did not print the result out to let the professor see.
So in the feedback, I added a print() function to make the result clear.

In mysterycode.py, I did not explain what the meaning of the codes successfully. I explained like this "repeat this loop until n is smaller than 50 or equals to 50".
So I checked the code again and figured out the meaning of these codes, which is "Selects a random number between 1 and 100 until a number less than 50 is selected, which is then printed" successfully.

In r_rate.py file, there were two mistakes.
The first one was that there were a lot of small errors in my codes. 
For example,  I missed a colon at the end of the first line of the for loop, and I mistakely added a string type to the numbers which were used to calculate. 
So I checked the codes carefully, found out all the mistakes, modified them and ran them without mistakes.
The second one was that, when asked to calculate the final number of infected persons, I failed to work out the correct answer. 
The reason wa that I used the number of infected people in the new round to calculate the results of the next round, but forgot to add the number of infected people originally.
So I modified the origin codes, changed the calculating pattern of infected people in codes, and got the final answer 3430 in the last.

Practical 6
In Coronavirus_rates.py file, there were two mistakes.
The first one was that I did not display frequency table that matched the input when the input table was changed. 
So I returned to calculate the total cases of five countries, calculated the frequency of each country correspondingly and made them into a table.
The second one was that I forgot to add a title to the pie chart. So I used a plt.title() function to add a title named "The total number of cases for USA, India, Brazil and Russia".
